Data Science Job Salaries

The project includes data analysis and a prediction of salaries in the field of data science. I use python for data analysis and scikit-learn for the prediction. I use linear regression as a model to predict salary.
The data set includes salary information for employees working in a number of different industries on different levels of﻿ experience in different countries and organizations. The data set is from kaggle.com link below

First, there is﻿ a data analysis step where different parameters are considered such as seniority level, company size, location etc. The data is cleaned and some features are selected. Before I start modelling, I prepare the data for modelling using pandas and data frames. I've done correlation matrix. Then I start a linear regression model to predict the salary.
